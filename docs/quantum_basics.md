## What is a Qubit?
- Qubits are the basic unit of quantum information.
- Unlike classical bits, qubits exist in a **superposition** of states.

## Superposition
- A qubit can be in state `|0⟩`, `|1⟩`, or a combination `α|0⟩ + β|1⟩`.

## Entanglement
- Two qubits are entangled when the state of one depends on the other.

## Measurement
- Measuring collapses a qubit’s state into either `|0⟩` or `|1⟩`.

## Basic Gates
- **X**: bit-flip (NOT)
- **H**: puts qubit into superposition
- **CNOT**: conditional bit-flip

## Quantum vs Classical
Classical - 
Unit of info: Bit (0 or 1)
Computation: Deterministic 
Speed ups: linear 

Quantum - 
Unit of info: Qubit (superposed)
Computation: Probabilistic
Speedups: Exponential (for some tasks)
